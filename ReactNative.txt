Hybrid apps:

 Application built using javascript,css,html,looks like native apps.

Why Hybrid Apps?

-incase native apps, we need to maintain two code base for both platform.

Why not to build one single portable app for all platforms?

 That is birth of hybrid apps.

Hybrids apps can be built using existing web tech- js,css,html.
Js is simple dom language, how to access platform services such as contacts,networks,storage..
- a lib was created -cordova , based on cordova adobe started building a framework on top of the cordova , called phoneGap.
